	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p class="article">
	During Shamisa's career as a Marketing and Research Professional and Proposal/Grant Administrator, she had the opportunity to develop informative articles, email blast campaigns, and proposals/grants applications.  Below are articles that were published in the Utah State Troopers Quarterly Magazine.  The first article discusses the advancement in DNA technology, specifically, how mitochondrial DNA testing assisted in the identification of the remains in the Tomb of the Unknown Solider.  The second article discusses the role of private and public forensic DNA laboratories in the United States.  Additionally,  there are two samples of email blast campaigns and a list of contracts and awards of successful proposals and grant applications. </p>
	
	<h2>New Type of DNA Technology Identified Remains in the Tomb of the Unknown Solider</h2>
	 <p>In 1972 First Lieutenant Michael Joseph Blassie 24, was presumed dead when his A-37B Dragonfly was shot down over South Vietnam.  Blassie crashed in an area controlled by enemy forces making it impossible to examine the crash site at that time.  Five months after the crash, the South Vietnamese Army patrol performed a sweep of the area, and discovered several items including: a pelvis, an upper arm bone, some ribs, remnants of a flight suit, a life raft, pieces of a parachute, and part of a USAF holster.  The evidence was turned over to the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, in Hawaii, for analysis and identification.  The remains were initially classified as Lt. Blassie, but analysis of the bones was not a compelling match to Lt. Blassie age or height.  Because there was no DNA technology at the time, a positive identification could not be made of the remains.  The remains were designated as Unknown and assigned the number X-26.  The remains were laid to rest at the Tomb of the Unknown at the Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
	
	<p> In 1991 the Department of Defense founded the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL). DNA Technology had surfaced and the forensic scientists at AFDIL were using advanced DNA technology to identify soldiers (unknown remains) from various wars.  The aged and damaged samples of bones (“X-26”) were analyzed through Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing.  Mitochondrial DNA testing is the most sensitive DNA Testing method available and is excellent for severely degraded samples. This advanced DNA technology analyzes (DNA from the maternal lineage) the maternal inheritance of a person and remains can be compared to any maternal relative (family members that share the same mother will have the same mtDNA sequences).  The remains of the unknown solider were matched to reference samples of Lt. Blassie’s mother and sister through mtDNA technology.  The mtDNA technology revealed that the remains found in South Vietnam were that of Lt. Blassie.  In 1998, Lt. Blassie was finally laid to rest near his hometown with full military honors! </p>
	
	<p> This case and other related cases revolutionized the use of mtDNA to also solve criminal cases.  Mitochondrial testing is performed at the FBI and at only a few private and state crime laboratories across the country.  MtDNA is a complex type of DNA testing that works well on highly degraded samples.  Samples such as skeletal remains, teeth and hair shafts frequently yield mitochondrial DNA results when nuclear DNA analysis is not possible.  DNA Technology has enhanced our capabilities for solving crimes.  Over the past two decades, DNA technology has been used to help identify persons in mass disasters, missing person cases, and criminal cases.  The benefits of DNA technology is exemplified in the case of the tomb of the unknown solider. DNA technology continues to play a vital role in the identification of a soldier killed in the line of duty. </p>
	
	<p> Sorenson Forensics is the only private forensic DNA Laboratory in the mountain west region   (Salt Lake City, UT), that offers mtDNA technology to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes.  Specifically, Sorenson has used this DNA technology to help identify persons in mass disasters, missing person cases, and cold cases.  Sorenson has been on the cutting edge of DNA testing for eight years.  Because of Sorenson’s expertise and reputation they were selected to assist the Thai government in identifying victims of the Tsunami tragedy of December 2004. Sorenson’s laboratory efficiently tested almost 1,300 specimens to quickly reunite families with victims and help provide closure. In addition to tsunami services, Sorenson assisted the government of Chechnya in identifying the victims of the elementary school bombing in September of 2004.  Sorenson’s forensic casework experience includes analyzing cases from law enforcement agencies across the United States. </p>
	
	
	<h2>Understanding the Different Roles of Private and Public Forensic DNA Laboratories</h2>
	
	<p> What is the role of a private forensic DNA lab? Why do we need private DNA labs? How do private and public government DNA labs collaborate?   I sat down with Tim Kupferschmid, Executive Director/Laboratory Director at Sorenson Forensics, LLC (a Salt Lake City based private forensics DNA lab) to discuss the role of a private DNA lab in the United States.  This is what I learned…</p>
	
	<p>There are nearly 200 government DNA labs in the United States that perform forensic DNA analysis.  You will find forensics DNA labs that operate at various levels of the government to include; the national (FBI), the state, county, and city (local) level. There are approximately 22 private DNA labs in the United States.  Both private and government DNA labs are able to maintain accreditation by either the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD/LAB) and/or the Forensic Quality Services (FQS-I). Accreditation is essential to ensure that the high standards for quality DNA testing are fulfilled. </p>
	
	<p> Often referred to as public labs (the service provided is usually free for law enforcement agencies), government DNA labs bear the responsibility of processing thousands of evidence items each year for law enforcement agencies throughout their state.  The increasing demand for testing criminal evidence items for DNA has created a backlog situation. This backlog of casework has a tremendous impact on the criminal justice system. </p>
	
	<p> The answer to the question, “Why do we need private DNA labs?” comes down to one simple answer.  The answer is choice.  To fully understand this answer, one must look at the myriad of choices in regards to DNA testing technology capabilities and the advantage of a quick turn-around time offered at a private DNA lab.  The majority of the testing performed by private DNA labs is done at the request of government DNA labs that are working to reduce their backlog of casework.  Government DNA labs receive funding from the federal government that can be used to outsource casework to private DNA labs. </p>
	
	<p> Some law enforcement agencies will by-pass their government DNA lab and submit forensic evidence to private DNA labs.  The choice to be able to get results faster is the main driver for this direct submission.  Due to the current casework loads, it is common for a government DNA lab to have a turn-around time of over six months to produce DNA analysis results.  On the other hand, private DNA labs produce results faster to justify their market position.  The average turn around time for private DNA labs is between 30-60 days. </p>
	
	<p> Another difference between a private DNA lab and a government DNA lab is the availability of the types of DNA testing.  The majority of DNA test that are performed under today’s standard technology are referred to as STR (Short-Tandem repeat) tests.  The average public DNA lab will have this basic technology in place.  Often, government DNA labs find it hard to justify spending the extra money to bring in specialized DNA tests.  A private lab must push the envelope to differentiate them in the market place; therefore a private DNA lab is most likely to have additional DNA testing options (advanced/specialized DNA technology) in order to attract customers who are willing to pay for specialized DNA testing. </p>
	
	<p> There are two main areas of specialized DNA tests.  The first is called Y-STR.  This test became available 5 years ago and is male specific.  The test gets its name in reference to the Y-chromosome that is unique to each male.  The Y-STR DNA test is especially effective in sexual assault cases where evidence might contain a mixture of DNA evidence from both a female and male.  In many cases the abundance of female DNA can override the presence of smaller amounts of male DNA.  Because this test focuses only on the male DNA, the chances of getting DNA results from this type have increased by 84% according to work performed at Sorenson Forensics, LLC over the past two years. </p>
	
	<p> The second main area of specialized DNA testing is referred to as mtDNA or mitochondrial DNA testing.  The mtDNA test is vastly different from STR or Y-STR testing which look at the nucleus of a human cell for the genetic testing.    Mitochondrial testing looks at the cells located outside of the nucleus.  The testing or sequencing is totally different from STR or Y-STR testing with no direct comparison between the two types of tests.   Bone, teeth and hair are prime examples of evidence that might be a better candidates for mtDNA testing especially if they are degraded and contain very little nuclear DNA. </p>
	
	<p> Private DNA labs are known for being early adopters of advanced DNA Technology.  Currently, there are a few private DNA labs (and some public DNA labs) that perform a specialized DNA test that is considered to be the latest in DNA technology.  The advanced DNA technology is called Minifiler (also known as min-STR).  Minifiler is a specialized DNA test that helps to maximize the results obtained from highly-degraded DNA evidence samples.  This specific test works well on cold case evidence that has been stored for many years. </p>
	
	<p> Private DNA labs, government DNA labs, and law enforcement agencies all need to work together to ensure the best options for DNA analysis is performed on evidence items from criminal cases.  The term “Collaborative Forensics” (made popular by the team at Sorenson Forensics) refers to this relationship.  The collaborative approach between law enforcement agencies, private and government DNA labs to investigate crimes has allowed several communities nationwide to benefit from this unique concept.  Each entity has its primary function, all with the ultimate goal of establishing a safer nation by solving criminal cases.  The following list reflects the functions of each entity and how each one plays an important role in the fight to solve criminal cases. </p>
