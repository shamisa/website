Self Critique Memo: Project 2: COM530 Fall 2011-Professor Karl Stolley


Shamisa Ingram: Project 2 Evaluation
------------------------------------
I accomplished Project 2 objectives of designing a site that establishes a solid and sound representation of myself and my skills, based on my career or field of study/area of expertise. I continued to use CSS to control the layout and design of my XHTML pages, using grid-based design methods for layout and typography and I was able to design my website for a baseline browser, test it in different browsers and make conditional comments for I.E.   The area that was challenging for me in this project was organizing and styling my site using responsive design techniques for maximum rhetorical effect under particular viewing conditions (mobile, tablet, desktop), specifically, media quieries.  

 The reading assignments aided in my understanding of the overall concept of responsive web design. Specifically, Wilson Miner, Setting Type on the Web to a Baseline Grid and Ethan Marcotte, Responsive Web Design were great resources for me.  Additionally, validating my pages against the W3C CSS and Markup Validation services facilitated my awareness of correctly applying structural content.  


My Progress in COM 530 Standards Base Web-Design
------------------------------------------------
I have a better understanding of XHTML and CSS and grid-base design methods.  I believe I need additional practice with media quieries.  I believe with continuous practice I will gain a greater command of responsive web designs.  I look forward to enhancing my website in project 3.
